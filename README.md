# anti-codehs

in 9th grade, codehs had this really annoying feature where the website saved a snapshot of your code every second so the teacher could see if you copy pasted or anything like that.    
     
so i made this code in 9th grade and it emulates human behaviour while typing code (10% random chance of stopping for 14 seconds mid code, a fairly average typing speed, etc.).    
     
also if ur teacher turns off copy and pasting entirely in ur course, then this will also bypass that.
