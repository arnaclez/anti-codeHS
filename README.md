# anti-codeHS

in 9th grade, codehs had this really annoying feature where the website saved a snapshot of your code every second so the teacher could see if you copy pasted or anything like that.    
     
so i made this code in 9th grade and it emulates human behaviour while typing code (13% random chance of stopping for 14 seconds mid code, a fairly average typing speed, etc.).    
     
also if ur teacher turns off copy and pasting entirely in ur course, then this will also bypass that.

to use:
- sign in to the MacOS app store
- download betternet vpn
- sign out of the App Store via settings
- turn on betternet vpn
- downpoad firefox
- turn off betternet vpn
- download tampermonkey from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/
- paste the script.js code into a new tampemonkey script (delete the template code)
- press ctrl+\ or cmd+\ and two prompts will pop up. i leave them blank, but you can customize based on your use case
- a textbox will appear at the bottom of the screen. paste the code into the textbox and click the enter button
- the script will work after clicking the enter button
