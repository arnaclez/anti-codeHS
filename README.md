# anti-codehs

in 9th grade, codehs had this really annoying feature where the website saved a snapshot of your code every second so the teacher could see if you copy pasted or anything like that.    
     
so i made this code in 9th grade and it emulates human behaviour while typing code (13% random chance of stopping for 14 seconds mid code, a fairly average typing speed, etc.).    
     
also if ur teacher turns off copy and pasting entirely in ur course, then this will also bypass that.

to use:
- download firefox from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1blEKbEn4iNLqp9c57dub0SyZIUexBFgB/view?usp=drive_link (or the official firefox download website if your not on the school wifi)
- download tampermonkey from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/
- paste the script.js code into a new tampemonkey script (delete the template code)
- keep the script disabled by default, but if you need to use it, enable it and refresh your codehs page
- after enabling, a textbox will appear at the bottom of the screen. paste the code into the textbox and click the enter button
- the script will work after clicking enter.
